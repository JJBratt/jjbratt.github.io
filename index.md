## 📖 Introduction
Welcome to State! This application serves as a compile-time state machine designed in C++. It aims to simplify the management of states through a transition table. While this tool is still under development, it shows promise for efficient state handling in various applications.

## 🛠️ Features
- **Compile-Time Efficiency**: Processes states during compile time, which can speed up runtime performance.
- **Transition Table**: This feature defines clear connections between states, making transitions predictable and manageable.
- **Easy Iteration**: Simplified entry iteration enables users to follow state changes easily.
- **Template Metaprogramming**: Utilizes advanced C++ techniques, providing a learning opportunity for developers interested in meta-programming.

## 📊 System Requirements
- **Operating System**: Windows, macOS, or Linux
- **Compiler**: A C++17 compatible compiler 
- **Memory**: At least 1 GB RAM
- **Disk Space**: Minimum of 20 MB free space
